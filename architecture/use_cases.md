# **Vision for the Standalone Platform**

The vocabulary application is designed as a standalone platform aimed at:

- **Book Readers**: Enabling them to save, explore, and understand words encountered during reading.  
- **Learners**: Providing an engaging, exploratory, and gamified experience for learning and retaining vocabulary.  

This platform will establish a solid foundation for user engagement with plans to expand into additional tools (e.g., OCR, browser extensions) in future phases.

  - Ability to revisit saved words later for further exploration and learning.

### **2. Learners (Casual and Exploratory)**

- **Needs**: Fun, engaging, self-driven vocabulary-building methods.  
- **Pain Points**: Monotony in traditional learning methods and lack of clear progress tracking.  
- **Proposed Features**:
  - Games and quizzes tailored to saved words.
  - Daily word suggestions to spark curiosity and discovery.  
  - Progress tracking via visual growth indicators (e.g., streaks, badges, levels).  
  - Toughened retention through spaced repetition algorithms.

## **User Stories**

### **For Book Readers**

1. **Word Lookup**  
   - As a book reader, I want to quickly look up a word's definition, examples, and related information, so I can continue reading without disruption.  
2. **Saving Words**  
   - As a book reader, I want to save words I discover to a personal collection, so I can revisit and learn them later.  
3. **Contextual Learning**  
   - As a book reader, I want to see examples of a word in context (literature, media, quotes), so I can better understand its usage.  
4. **Personalized Lists**  
   - As a book reader, I want to organize saved words into categorized lists (e.g., genres, books), so I can tailor the experience to my preferences.  

### **For Learners**

5. **Daily Word Discovery**  
   - As a learner, I want to receive daily word suggestions with definitions, examples, and etymology, so I can expand my vocabulary naturally.

## **Developer Stories**

### **Technical Requirements**

1. **Standalone Word Lookup Engine**
   - Create a word lookup engine that provides definitions, etymology, and real-world examples for users.  
2. **Word Saving and Categorization**  
   - Develop backend functionality to enable users to save words, create categories/lists, and organize them.  
3. **Daily Word Discovery Algorithm**  
   - Construct a system to curate and suggest daily words based on user preferences and history.  
4. **Gameplay Mechanics**  
   - Build interactive games like:
     - Word-guessing games (e.g., fill-the-blank or multiple-choice quizzes).  
     - Matching synonyms and antonyms.  
     - Spaced repetition-based reviews of saved words.  
5. **Progress Tracking Visualizations**  
   - Implement visuals for activity tracking (e.g., word streaks, game completions, badges).  
6. **Contextual Example Integration**  
   - Integrate contextual data from books, articles, or curated sources to enrich definitions.
7. **Preference Management System**  
   - As a developer, I need to create a backend and UI system that allows users to update and save preferences such as:
     - Notification settings (enable/disable word suggestions, reminders).  
     - App theme (e.g., light/dark mode).  
     - Preferred languages for word lookup and app interface.  
     - Frequency for daily word discovery notifications or reminders.

## **Future Expansion (Tool Features Phase)**

This is the second phase, where tools extend the standalone platform:

1. **OCR Integration**: Allow users to scan words from physical books in real-time using their phone camera.  
2. **Browser Extensions**: Enable one-click word lookup and saving within digital reading experiences.  
3. **Integration with Reading Platforms**: Partner with ecosystems like Kindle or PDFs for seamless integration.
